# Chaos-hamiltonian

There is two repository, one is for a code if you want to work on only one trajectory, its named "Short codes". And one who will made a lot of trajectory but can be very long (several hour) named "Long codes".

In the short one. There is three code, two will give the data for one trajectory, with different potential. The last code is the one who will take the data and will give the differents Poincaré section.
There is a repository that will take all the data for the first two code and the picture given by it. And there is 3 other repository that will take the Poincaré section for the section in the plane X, Y or Z. The name of the Poincaré section will give the different parameter and the axis.

In the long one its the same but without the data and the Poincaré code because the Poincaré section are already in the code. There is a .mp3 sound to tell us when the code is finished because he's too long.

If you want to change something in the code you can open it and change the parameter at the begining.
For the integration part you can change the h value (the step), or N (size of the integration).
For the poincaré section you can change the C_(x,y,z) values that will change were the Poincaré section is taken. And at the end you can change the different axis were you want to take it.
